# Shuffling-Parities
Given an array A consisting of N positive integers. Shuffles the array A and creates a new array B of length N, where Bi=(Ai+i)mod2, for each i(1≤i≤N).
Find the maximum possible sum of integers of the array B, Shuffles the array A optimally.
* Constraints
 1≤T≤10^4
 1≤N≤10^5
 1≤Ai≤10^9 
 Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
